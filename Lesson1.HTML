            <h1>We believe in a world where everyone can be Well-Traveled</h1>
            <p>At Expedia Group, we believe travel is a force for good. Our mission is to power global travel for everyone, everywhere. We are committed to ensuring access for all travelers. Travel serves as a gateway to the world, allowing us to connect with others, share our experiences, and broaden our horizons.

                Travel should be enabled, encouraged and championed, but we know everyone does not have the same access to experience these opportunities. Expedia Group is committed to using our brands, tools and platforms to power a more inclusive travel industry.
                
                From family and business travel to the trip of a lifetime, Expedia Group’s brands unlock possibilities for ALL travelers.

            <p>In 2022, we launched Expedia Group’s Open
                World™ social impact and sustainability
                strategy to begin addressing inequities across
                the travel industry and democratizing access
                for all travelers. Our journey toward a more
                inclusive travel industry is the focus for this study.
                This original research seeks to identify shared
                travel challenges of underserved groups,
                including Black, Latino, LGBTQIA+, and travelers
                with disabilities. By examining the planning
                and experience of their journeys, we’ve
                identified persistent pain points that need
                immediate attention and action. We’ve also
                included recommendations for how to address
                those pain points, based directly on these
                firsthand insights.
                What we learn in this study invites us as
                an industry to create more inclusive travel
                experiences together. Not only is it the right
                thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do. This study
                demonstrates what we’ve long known to be
                true: embedding inclusive practices across our
                products and services does more than enhance
                brand appeal and loyalty. It creates significant
                growth opportunities by meeting the needs of
                more travelers. Companies and partners that
                take the time to meet these needs stand to gain
                the most.</p>
            <p>Addressing these issues not only helps those
                directly affected; it benefits everyone by
                facilitating a better understanding among
                people across backgrounds and cultures. These
                challenges require a unified industry effort
                to ensure travel is enabled, encouraged, and
                championed for everyone, everywhere. And
                they present the opportunity for us and our
                partners, in alignment with our Open World™
                framework, to innovate across the travel sector.
                We invite you to discover how we can drive
                this change together by visiting https://www.
                expediagroup.com/travel-with-us. As an
                industry, we can create a more inclusive and
                accessible global travel ecosystem.
                Thank you for joining us on this journey toward
                a more open world.</p>
